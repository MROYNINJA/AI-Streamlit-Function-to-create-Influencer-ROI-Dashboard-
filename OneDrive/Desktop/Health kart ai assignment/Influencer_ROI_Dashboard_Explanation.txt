Influencer ROI Dashboard – Step-by-Step Explanation (Plain Text)

1. Overview:
   - This is a dashboard to track how much revenue each influencer brings compared to what they are paid.
   - The goal is to calculate metrics like ROI (Return on Investment) and ROAS (Return on Ad Spend).

2. Setup Instructions:
   - Install the required Python packages (Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy).
   - Run the file using the command `streamlit run "AI dashboard.py"`.

3. Data Used (Simulated):
   - Influencers data: Contains influencer details like name, followers, category, and platform.
   - Posts data: Captures posts made by influencers including likes, comments, and captions.
   - Tracking data: Simulates sales or actions users took after seeing influencer posts.
   - Payouts data: How much the influencer was paid (either per post or per sale).

4. Dashboard Layout:
   - The dashboard title appears at the top.
   - A sidebar allows users to filter by platform (like Instagram or YouTube).

5. Filtering:
   - When a platform is selected, all related data (influencers, posts, payouts, and tracking) is filtered accordingly.

6. Data Merging:
   - The different datasets are joined into one table to bring together revenue, payouts, and influencer info.

7. Metrics Calculation:
   - ROI is calculated by comparing revenue generated versus payout.
   - ROAS is calculated as total revenue divided by total payout.

8. Dashboard Displays:
   - Shows three key metrics: total revenue, total payout, and average ROI.
   - Displays a table of each influencer’s performance.
   - Highlights the top 5 influencers with the highest ROI.
   - Flags influencers with poor ROI (less than 0.5).

9. Download Option:
   - The dashboard lets users download the report in CSV format.

10. Assumptions:
   - The data is simulated.
   - Payouts could be fixed or based on performance.
   - Revenue is assumed to be accurately tracked.

This explanation avoids technical code and helps understand how the dashboard works step by step.
